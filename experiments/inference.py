# can we add persistence to a neural network?

# what does persistence mean? "The brain possesses many different types of oscillators with different periods"
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_rhythm

# what if there is a happy medium between recurrent, residual, and feed forward neural networks? One that learns the tradeoffs
# between the connections of various "neurons" beyond JUST weighting? if you think about our brains, we have multiple lobes
# where different things happen. For example, the temporal lobe 
# "contains regions dedicated to processing sensory information, particularly important for hearing, recognising language, and forming memories."
